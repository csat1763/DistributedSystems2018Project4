1. t2 family spot-requests:
AWS doesn't want to provide spot-instances for lower tier t2 instances hence a workaround is needed.
We used normal instances for every t2 instance to measure the speed.

2. Limitation on concurrent running instances:
AWS restricts the amount of cconcurrent running instances hence not every instance-type
can be tested at the same time.
Workaround: Find a sequential execution order for the instances.

3. Spot-request very low limit:
Certain spot-instance-types like c5.2xlarge can only are restricted to 2 concurrently
running instances hence the measurement needs to be done in the first zone then in the second zone.
Again we are talking about sequential execution order.

4. AWS wont deliver spot-req:
AWS sometimes is not able to deliver a requested spot-instance.
Workaround: Fall back routine to starting normal instances if error occurs.

5. AWS wont start normal instance because of volume problems:
Workaround: try in endless while loop until it is finally delivered.
