## Task

1. Start the cheapest spot instances (check automatically in each region / availability zone)
2. Measure transfer time VM2VM (different instance types)
3. Determine the cost-performance trade-off

## Code

The code can be found in the *Code* folder. To execute the code do the following...

     $ ./main.sh
	 
To stop all spot-requests and terminate all running instances run...
	 
	 $ ./terminateAll.sh

## Results

The results can be found in the *Results* folder. The results are stored in a *.csv* file. The measurements are evaluated in an Excel Sheet.
